Backups
=========

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/osu-sig/Backups-Widget/master/screenshot.png)

## What is it?

The Backups widget is good way to combine tabular and graphical data into a single tile. 

## What kind of data does the bar graph need?

The bar graph assumes you are handing it a number of bytes. It will automatically convert it to a human-friendly format and append the most appropriate units. 

## How do I use it?

The required data format can be a bit confusing, so see the demo job for examples. 

## Are there any dependencies?

Just the number_helpers.js that comes with it.
